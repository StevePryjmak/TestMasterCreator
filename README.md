# My notes

I whant create project which will be have options to create test and practis 
Main problems Dont sure for now how to handle difrent types of questin i thougth about 
making base one test class and then extends form it and save like in C++ pointer on base class and use dynamik casting
but problem is i thinking aobut making gui and will extend from gui elements probably i can save like pointer on base class of gui
but not shure if it is best aprouch

Second problem i'm thinking about how to save tset i thoud about Serialize my test class and just save in bit format but i'm not sure whether 
when i chage sorse code would it be problem for my old saved test. If bit format saves only field probably not but if it works other way then i think i could be a problem with this
